I am in the process of writing a concept record about the past, present and future relationship with my sons mother. I think a lot of people will relate to it because we have all loved and lost. I only have about 10% of this record completed but the cover art is finished, I knew exactly what and how I wanted it to be. The people in it are not me nor anyone I know, just very fitting for the story I am telling..

The first is the front cover and the second is the back cover.
