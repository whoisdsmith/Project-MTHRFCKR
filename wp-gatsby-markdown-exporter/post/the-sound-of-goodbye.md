I was living in the hopes that you would stay  
I never knew you were dying just to get away  
I spent those last few months staying up at night  
You spent those months practicing the sound of goodbye

Which meant

No more i Iove yous, no more goodnights  
No more “how was your day” and “are you alright?”  
No more fighting, no more lying, no more reasons to continue trying  
cause whats the point when everything you love is gone  
some will fall apart while others fall back in love
