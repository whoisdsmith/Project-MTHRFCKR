This house is empty and so am I.

Regrets haunt me, they eat through these bones and into my soul

I watched you grow up through pictures and phone lines.

If I could go back I would change everything, I didn’t know my job would tear us apart, I didn’t know how much I neglected you. A lesson I had to learn too late, by the time I realized what I had done you were gone.

The hardest lessons we learn too late.  
My chest is empty with out you with me
